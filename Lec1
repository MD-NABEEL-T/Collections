To represent 10000 int values we cant declare individually 
so we go for arrays concept
BIGGEST ADV OF ARRAY is storing using only one variable

But there are some limitations of arrays:
1.Arrays are fixed in size.
2.Arrays can hold only homogenous data element
 for example :

//Student[] s = new Student(); // ❌ wrong
Student[] s = new Student[3];
 s[0]=new Student();
 s[1]=new Customer();
