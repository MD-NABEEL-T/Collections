One-line interview killer answer 💣
Arrays are fixed-size, type-restricted, and lack flexibility, which is why Java Collections were introduced.

To represent 10000 int values we cant declare individually 
so we go for arrays concept
BIGGEST ADV OF ARRAY is storing using only one variable

But there are some limitations of arrays:
1.Arrays are fixed in size.
2.Arrays can hold only homogenous data element
 for example :

//Student[] s = new Student(); // ❌ syntax wrong (check basicstuff.txt)
Student[] s = new Student[3];
 s[0]=new Student();
 s[1]=new Customer();
cant add this customer is the limitation.

but we can do like this.
 Object[] a=new Object[1000];
 a[0]=new Student();
 a[1]=new Customer();

 NOTE:object[] a = new object[1000]; // ❌
❌ Wrong (Java is case-sensitive)

COLLECTIONS
👉 contains() is a method used to check whether an element exists in a collection.
collections are growable in nature 
collections can hold both homo and heterogenous.
